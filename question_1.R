# The analyses were carried out using the afex package (Singmann H, Bolker B,
# Westfall J, Aust F & Ben-Shachar M, 2022) to fit the ANOVA model for the
# response time measure in R version 4.2.2 (R Development Core Team,
# 2020). Pairwise comparisons conducted with the emmeans package (Lenth R, 2022)
# were used to investigate the interaction for the response time measure.

# We found a significant effect of response time (F (1,94) = 15.828,
# p < .001, generalised Î·2 = .14411). Tukey comparisons revealed that the
# visually degraded group performed significantly worse than the normal group
# (18.1 ms slower, t = -3.978, p < 0.001).
